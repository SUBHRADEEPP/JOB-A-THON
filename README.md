<I>Predicting Employee Attrition</I><br>
<p>In recent years, attention has increasingly been paid to human resources (HR), since worker quality and skills represent a growth factor and a real competitive advantage for companies. After proving its mettle in sales and marketing, artificial intelligence is also becoming central to employee-related decisions within HR management. Organizational growth largely depends on staff retention. Losing employees frequently impacts the morale of the organization and hiring new employees is more expensive than retaining existing ones.</p><br>
<p>You are working as a data scientist with HR Department of a large insurance company focused on sales team attrition. Insurance sales teams help insurance companies generate new business by contacting potential customers and selling one or more types of insurance. The department generally sees high attrition and thus staffing becomes a crucial aspect</p><br>
