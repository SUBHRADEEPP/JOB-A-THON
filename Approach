Approach
Problem Statement: The problem asked to predict possible future attrition value based on employee data and performance. The attrition value according to the problem statement must be classified into 0 (no attrition) and 1(yes attrition). 
Model Selection: As attrition is defined by binary value 0 and 1, logistic regression model became the natural choice for machine learning. 
Data Pre-processing: Since the dataset had no Attrition feature defined beforehand, I had to pre-process the data for the creating a new feature called ‘Attrition’. Also, the ‘Total Business Value’ for each employee was maintained monthly basis for each employee, which led to redundant rows in the dataset. So, I aggregated the ‘Total Business Value’ for each employee on the ‘Emp_ID’ feature and created a new Dataframe. Dropped the ‘Total Business Value’ feature from the initial Dataframe and dropped the duplicate rows using the ‘Emp_ID’ feature. Thereafter defined a function to calculate Attrition value and created a new feature called ‘Attrition’ using the ‘LastWorkingDate’ feature. Subsequently I merged the the two different dataframes to get data with unique rows where every row represented unique employee ID. Thereafter I one hot encoded ‘Gender’ and ‘Education Level’ features and concatenated them to the final training Dataframe.
Feature Engineering: Plotted a heat map of the correlation coefficients between each and every feature of the final training dataframe. The heat map showed that ‘Salary’,’Designation’,’Quaterly Rating’,’Total Business Value’ is negatively correlated while all other features almost have no correlation with the Attrition feature. Hence chose the above four features for machine learning
Machine Learning: Created independent and target variable for training logistic model and fit the data into the model. Subsequently predicted attrition for the provided ‘Emp_ID’ with learned logistic model.
